#### 1.Types of elements inn HTML?
There are mainly two types in HTML elements 
1.Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line. Block-level element always takes up the full width available. It has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.
Example: 
<div>Helloworld</div>
<address>, <h1>, <aside>, <main> , <nav> and etc

2.Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. 
Example:
<span> tag is good example for Inline-element.
<span>Hello Sathya</span>
<a>, <button>, <label>, <textarea> , <input> etc.
